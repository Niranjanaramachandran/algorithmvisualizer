# -Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualizer
Developed a web-based interactive Pathfinding Visualizer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, implementing
 AI search algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstraâ€™s, and A* to demonstrate how each explores and finds optimal
 paths in a grid-based environment.
 
 Implemented automatic pathfinding option and Enabled real-time visualization with dynamic maze generation, obstacle placement, and animated path
 tracing, helping users understand algorithm behavior, decision-making, and time complexity through a
 user-friendly interface.
